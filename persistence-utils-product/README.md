# Persistence Utils
Axon Ivy's JPA Persistence Lib utility helps you accelerate process automation initiatives by introducing an abstraction DAO layer. This utility:
- Allows robust database access
- Helps you create DAO classes for your entities with direct access to databases using standard APIs
- Simplifies the creation of typical entity classes
- Supports you with an easy-to-copy demo implementation to reduce your integration effort.

## Demo
