**Persistence Utils**  is a library based on the Java Persistence API (JPA) which will help you to start a
database related Axon Ivy project quickly. It provides an abstraction DAO hierarchy to allow for more complex
database access and convenient use.

The library helps you create DAO classes of your entities which have all the APIs for fully database access.
Besides, it also helps you quickly create some typical Entity classes with boiler-plate requirements, like
simple audtiting features.
